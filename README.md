# ArtiTune

A creative drawing-to-sound application that transforms your artistic strokes into musical compositions. Draw on the canvas and watch your art come alive with sound!

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing Canvas**: Draw freely on a responsive HTML5 canvas
- **Sound Generation**: Each stroke generates unique sounds based on:
  - Stroke length
  - Drawing speed
  - Stroke duration
  - Color/instrument selection
- **Multiple Instruments**: Choose from 5 different sound instruments:
  - ðŸ”´ **Piano** (Red)
  - ðŸ”µ **Synth** (Blue) 
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Pluck** (Green)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Bell** (Yellow)
  - ðŸŸ£ **Pad** (Purple)
- **Replay System**: Watch and listen to your drawing being recreated with synchronized audio
- **Real-time Feedback**: See stroke count and live drawing updates

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

#### Option 1: Clone from existing repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd artitune
```

#### Option 2: Set up from local directory
If you're starting from this local project:

1. Initialize git repository (if not already done):
```bash
git init
```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab and add it as remote:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

3. Add and commit files:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

4. Push to remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

#### Continue with setup:

5. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How to Use

1. **Select an Instrument**: Click on any colored circle to choose your instrument/sound
2. **Start Drawing**: Click and drag on the canvas to create strokes
3. **Listen**: Each stroke automatically generates sound based on your drawing characteristics
4. **Replay**: Click the "Replay" button to watch your entire composition recreated with audio
5. **Clear**: Use the "Clear" button to start fresh
6. **Stop**: Stop any ongoing replay with the "Stop" button

## Git Setup Commands
